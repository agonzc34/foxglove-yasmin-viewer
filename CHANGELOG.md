# foxglove-yasmin-viewer version history

## 1.0.0

- Completed the port for the Yasmin Viewer in Foxglove Studio. Now, there is no need to deploy a web server to visualize the state machines generated by Yasmin.
- You can view all state machines or select the one you prefer by choosing them from the extension's control panel.
- To manually clear non-existing state machines, there is a button on the control panel for this purpose.


## 1.0.1

- Fixed an error that prevented the state machines from uploading and caused them to stack on the viewer.
- Now clear button shold work as intended :)
