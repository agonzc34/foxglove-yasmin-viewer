## _A Foxglove Studio Extension_

[Foxglove Studio](https://github.com/foxglove/studio) allows developers to create extensions, or custom code that is loaded and executed inside the Foxglove Studio application. This can be used to add custom panels. Extensions are authored in TypeScript using the `@foxglove/studio` SDK.

## Develop

Extension development uses the `npm` package manager to install development dependencies and run build scripts.

To install extension dependencies, run `npm` from the root of the extension package.

```sh
npm install
```

You also need a modified version of the foxglove/schemas library, to generate the interfaces needed for the application to read the State Machine Messages. Download the extension at: [Foxglove Schema](https://github.com/foxglove/schemas) and place it next to the Foxglove Viewer directory.

Install the extension dependencies, copy the [setup/schemas.ts](setup/schemas.ts) in the Yasmin Viewer repo to the foxglove/schemas repo in internal/schemas.ts.

To generate the new interfaces for Foxglove, run:

```sh
npm run update-generated-files
```

To build and install the extension into your local Foxglove Studio desktop app, run:

```sh
npm run local-install
```

Open the `Foxglove Studio` desktop (or `ctrl-R` to refresh if it is already open). Your extension is installed and available within the app.

## Package

Extensions are packaged into `.foxe` files. These files contain the metadata (package.json) and the build code for the extension.

Before packaging, make sure to set `name`, `publisher`, `version`, and `description` fields in _package.json_. When ready to distribute the extension, run:

```sh
npm run package
```

This command will package the extension into a `.foxe` file in the local directory.

## Publish

You can publish the extension for the public marketplace or privately for your organization.
